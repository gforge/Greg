Maintainer: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Description: This R-package provides functions that primarily aimed at helping
    you work with regression models. While mych of the data presented by the
    standard regression output is useful and important - there is often a need
    for further simplifaction prior to publication. The methods implemented in
    this package are inspired by some of the top journals such as NEJM, BMJ,
    and other medical journals as this is my research field.
