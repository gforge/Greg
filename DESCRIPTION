Description: This R-package provides functions that primarily aimed at helping
    work with regression models in both conveying and modeling. While mych of 
    the data presented by the standard regression output is useful and important 
    - there is often a need for further simplifaction prior to publication. The methods implemented in
    this package are inspired by some of the top journals such as NEJM, BMJ,
    and other medical journals as this is my research field.
